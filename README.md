# Psychic-Game

Welcome to my Week 3 homework. This is a lightweight version of the classic game, "Hangman", where you, the player, must guess the letter that the computer is thinking of.

You have nine chances to guess the letter that the computer is thinking of. If you guess correctly within the nine guesses, you'll win! If you use all nine chances and do not guess the computer's letter, then you'll lose. But thankfully, you can always try again!

Here's a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/qTc45Lox97g</a>

## How to get started
------------------------

Press any letter to win the game!

**HINT:** The computer will only be thinking of alphabetical letters, so don't pick special characters as guesses!
